TODO for stage2 refinement

1. Improvement network load by replacing old data in the background periodically using a sync adapter. Make the intent service and sync adapter work in conjunction
This is done, will add clean up function

2. Prettier UI throughout
Added simpledecoration divider, may implement horizontal view for review

3. Fix loading and restoring of state : after pressing back button on the other views (non popular)  displays blank result (life cycle issue)
Fixed by loading saved loader from onActivityCreated

4. Restore/save view state on two pane view
